# A F# version of [this journey code challenge](https://github.com/mikehadlow/Journeys)

[This](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2019/10/28/a-basic-haskell-solution-to-the-robot-journeys-coding-exercise/) blog post by Mark Seemann inspired me to give it a go in F# to practice the language and some FP practices.

To run the project simply

`dotnet run`

or 

`dotnet run [filename.txt]` if you want to run a different file from `input.txt`

Any review is much appreciated!
